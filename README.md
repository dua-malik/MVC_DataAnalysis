## Objective:

In this project, I analyzed a dataset detailing motor vehicle collisions in the state of New York. The dataset spanned from the year 2012 to the present day. Each row represented a new collision (recorded daily). With over three million rows of data, I was tasked with extracting a subset of rows ranging from December 1st, 2019, to November 30th, 2021 to perform three separate analyses. Furthermore, I was responsible for analyzing data regarding the following vehicle makes which were used in the first two analyses:
1. Nissan
2. Kia
3. Hino
4. GMC
Using this subset of data, I explored how many accidents each vehicle make was involved in during the period. The first analysis investigated vehicle collisions on a yearly basis. The second analysis was like the first, however this time, I was also interested in the number of vehicle collisions on a month-to-month basis. The third and final analysis focused on the vehicle type. In this analysis, I investigated the overall proportion of vehicle collisions in New York based on vehicle type.

## Summary and Findings: 

### Distribution of Accidents Between December 2019 and November 2021:

After conducting the first analysis on the dataset ranging from December 2019 - November 2021, it was evident that Nissan Vehicle Makes were disproportionately involved in accidents compared to GMC, HINO, and KIA. Although one might draw the conclusion that drivers that have a Nissan vehicle make are more likely to get into an accident, it is important to

### Analyzing Trends Between Motor Vehicle Collision and Date of Occurence:

A study done by researchers at the University of Washing School of Public Health discovered a strong association between home values and obesity among women in Seattle and its suburbs. Using this study, obesity rates in both adult male and females were used as a parameter to check if this correlation was seen on a national level.

### Distribution of Vehicle Types Involved in Motor Vehicle Collisions Between December 2019 and November 2021:

A significant factor that highlights the economy of a state and nation is the unemployment rate. Many studies have shown that a higher unemployment rate is associated with lower housing prices, hence it is used as a parameter in this study to analyze the correlation between the two.

### Happiness Index Across States:

Quality of life is an important parameter before settling on buying a house. Quality of life is dependent on many parameter such work environment, communities, and the environment. The Happiness Index is a comprehensive survey instrument that assesses happiness, wellbeing, and aspects of sustainability and resilience. It is an important system that is used to correlate other life factors. In this analysis, the happiness index was analyzed across states to determine any correlation between a high total score on the index and any affect it has on the median homevalue prices in the nation.

### Correlation Matrices Between Parameters and Home List Prices:

<br>
Below, I produced correlation matrices between the median list prices of homes and varying parameters to explore how strong the correlation is between the two datasets. From the results we can see that the parameters that were explored above have low correlation scores when comparing its affects on list prices. There are many factors that play significant and or minor roles in the list price of homes. In this analysis I concluded that the parameters that were explored did not play a significant role in affecting the overall median list price of homes. To better improve this study, neighboring home list prices and historic property value should be evaluated as parameters that may produce a strong correlation value.

<br>
Despite the fact that the analyzed factors do not play a significant role, it is important to highlight that parameters such as walkability, quality of life, and access to public transportation do have a positive correlation when it comes to the median list prices. It is also important to note that working with a larger dataset may help identify the same parameters with different correlation values. In particular, many studies have found that there is a moderately strong negative correlation between unemployment rates and housing prices. In this analysis, we also concluded that unemployment rates and median housing list prices had a negative correlation however the value was low. In future studies, instead of list prices, closing prices should be analyzed.
