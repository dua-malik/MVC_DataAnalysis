## Objective:

In this project, I analyzed a dataset detailing motor vehicle collisions in the state of New York. The dataset spanned from the year 2012 to the present day. Each row represented a new collision (recorded daily). With over three million rows of data, I was tasked with extracting a subset of rows ranging from December 1st, 2019, to November 30th, 2021 to perform three separate analyses. Furthermore, I was responsible for analyzing data regarding the following vehicle makes which were used in the first two analyses:
<br>

1. Nissan
2. Kia
3. Hino
4. GMC
<br>

Using this subset of data, I explored how many accidents each vehicle make was involved in during the period. The first analysis investigated vehicle collisions on a yearly basis. The second analysis was like the first, however this time, I was also interested in the number of vehicle collisions on a month-to-month basis. The third and final analysis focused on the vehicle type. In this analysis, I investigated the overall proportion of vehicle collisions in New York based on vehicle type.

## Summary and Findings: 

### Distribution of Accidents Between December 2019 and November 2021:

After conducting the first analysis on the dataset ranging from December 2019 - November 2021, it was evident that Nissan Vehicle Makes were disproportionately involved in accidents compared to GMC, HINO, and KIA. Although one might draw the conclusion that drivers that have a Nissan vehicle make are more likely to get into an accident, it is important to understand what type of vehicle a Nissan is. 

Nissans are considered sedans, a vehicle type that is the most common car in America (“What is the most common car in America?”, 2022). Compared to GMC’s and HINO trucks, it is more likely that sedans are involved in more accidents considering their frequency in the states. Looking further into the analysis, KIA’s are considered sedan vehicle types as well. Compared to HINO and GMC they were also involved in around the same, if not more collisions during this period. This led to the question as to why more Nissan’s were involved in collisions compared to Kia’s as both are sedans. It is important to note that Nissan vehicle makes are one of the best-selling vehicles in the state of New York, which explains why they are involved in a considerable amount of collisions compared to the other vehicle makes (“The Bestselling Cars in Every State — and Your Cost To Own Them”, 2022).

Furthermore, if we take a look at the years for each of the vehicles makes, it is evident that in almost all vehicle makes, 2020 had the greatest number of collisions. This may be since New York hosts one of the largest tourist locations in the world, NYC. New York Cities attracts millions of tourists a month which may have been a cause for the collision rate being high. However, if we focus on the rate of 2021 collisions, we see a decline. This can be explained by looking at travel restrictions that were put in place during the pandemic.

### Analyzing Trends Between Motor Vehicle Collision and Date of Occurence:

As we focus on the second analysis, it is evident what role the pandemic had on motor vehicle collisions. The graph demonstrates a sharp decline in vehicle motor collisions across all vehicles makes around Mar-April 2020. This was around the time the strictest limitations were set in place to avoid spreading COVID. During this time, cities were under lockdown, many workplaces shifted to remote work, and schools were also taught online. This shift limited the need to drive around the state as it was considered a risk to the public. Furthermore, if we take a closer look at the second dip (between Jan-Mar 2021), we can expect a surge in COVID cases as well as many things such as work still being remote. If we look at statistics of COVID cases around this time daily cases ranged from 9,000-15,000 (“New York Coronavirus Map and Case Count”, 2021).

### Distribution of Vehicle Types Involved in Motor Vehicle Collisions Between December 2019 and November 2021:

A Moving along to the findings of the third analysis, as I stated before regarding sedans being a popular vehicle type among Americans, it is evident from the dataset that they are involved in a greater number of collisions compared to other vehicle types (56.82%). However, it is important to note that sport utility vehicles were also involved in a lot of collisions (38.69%). Like sedans, sport utility vehicles are a common choice among vehicle owners in America. Such vehicle types are made by a wide variety of car manufacturers including Nissan. Such statistics make sense as there are 9,552,792 standard vehicles (including sport utility vehicles and sedans) registered in the state of New York, compared to the 139,869 taxis, and 26,238 buses, it is logical to conclude that standard vehicles are involved in more collisions given the proportion of each vehicle type registered in the state (“NYS Vehicle Registrations of File - End of Year 2018”, 2018).
